# University Applications - Built with React TS and Spring REST API

## Description

Welcome to the **Student Application System**, a dynamic platform designed to streamline the process for students applying to various specialties across different faculties. Our system is crafted to simplify and enhance the application process, making it more accessible and manageable for students while providing robust control for administrators.

### For Students

Our platform offers a user-friendly experience where students can:

- **Browse Specialties**: Explore a wide range of specialties offered by different faculties.
- **Submit Applications**: Apply to their desired specialties with ease.
- **Complete Required Tests**: Take necessary tests, such as language proficiency exams, which are prerequisites for certain applications.
- **Upload Files**: Attach relevant documents or any files necessary for their application, such as resumes or certificates.
- **Track Application Status**: Stay informed about their application progress with real-time updates.
  - Students will also receive email notifications when their application status changes, ensuring they are always up-to-date.
- **Edit and Update Details**: Users can manage and update their personal details from their Profile page to keep their information accurate and current.
### For Administrators

We provide two types of administrative access to manage the platform effectively:

- **Read-Only Admins**: View data, including user profiles, applications, and status updates without making any changes.
- **Full-Access Admins**: Have comprehensive control, including the ability to accept or decline applications, remove applications, block user access, and modify user roles. All Admins also benefit from a robust tracking system that logs every action, such as application submissions and status changes.

### Key Features

- **Application Tracking System**: Monitors and logs each action taken within the platform, including application submissions and status adjustments.
- **Test Requirements**: Students may need to complete specific tests to meet application criteria, ensuring that only qualified candidates apply for each specialty.
- **Secure Application Process**: The application is strongly secured with the help of Spring Security and Keycloak, ensuring proper security and role management.
- **File Management**: Uploading and retrieving files is implemented with Minio, providing fast and efficient file storage and management.
